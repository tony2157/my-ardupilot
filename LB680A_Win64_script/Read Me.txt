Python Test Harness demonstrates how to communicate with the LB[4|5|6]xx family of LadyBug Technologies RF power sensors through python.

It identifies the bitness of the python environment, pre / post version 3.8 and if the sensor has been enumerated under the old or new driver to load the correct dll.

Please ensure that at least one application (e.g. Power Meter) is installed first and functions correctly before attempting python communication.  Only one application at a time should be active while controlling the sensor.

Commands demonstrated:
LB_InitializeSensor_Addr
LB_GetFrequency
LB_SetFrequency
LB_GetAverages
LB_SetAverages
LB_MeasureCW

For entire command list, please see documentation.

The demo requires the as distributed directory structure to function correctly in any environment.  However, only one version of the dlls is necessary for a given installation, so the user can simplify and rearrange as desired.
